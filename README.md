About a month ago Roblox introduced an IP-lock on cookies, meaning if you were to create an alt and use that alt's cookie to login to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) it would be invalidated. This can be replicated by creating a new account and then switching your IP using a VPN.

Use cases:
~ Multi-accounting (with multiple cookies you may not want to login to each)
~ The use of authentication required Roblox APIs with Proxies
~ Access to accounts that you may not have the login to anymore (via valid cookie)
